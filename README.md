## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris and I am a graduate from Rice University with a Masters in Data Science and also a graduate from the University of Houston with a double bachelors' in Public Health and Biology along with a minor in Mathematics. I have a very strong interest in anything healthcare and tech, but even outside of that, I just love to learn! Personally, I believe there's only one thing that would limit how much one can learn, and that is themselves. Right now, I am still building and adding things to my GitHub, but feel free to reach out about anything! ðŸ˜„
