## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Chris! I hold a Masterâ€™s in Data Science from Rice University and a double Bachelorâ€™s in Public Health and Biology, with a minor in Mathematics, from the University of Houston. I'm passionate about the intersection of healthcare and technologyâ€”but more than anything, I just love to learn. I believe the only true limit to learning is the one we place on ourselves.

I'm currently building out my GitHub portfolio, so stay tuned! Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate. ðŸ˜„
